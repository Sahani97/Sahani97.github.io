        <h1>Hey, guys!!</h1>

        <p>
            My name is Sahani. I'm 25, from Austria/Vienna with roots from Sri Lanka. I loooove being creative either old school with pen and paper or on my Computer.
             I've went to a few different school (I will not explain the school system in Austria now) but every school I went to after primary school had a main 
             focus on some type of computer science. In the school where I got my a-levels, I learned a lot about web-design, photography, videography but also 
             about editing videos and pictures. Which even more intrigued me to start making my own videos. I tried blogging in the past, I tried starting YouTube 
             in the past, but I was never too interested in sticking to do that on a regularâ€¦.soo I dropped it. But the pandemic and me failing my class during the 
             first lockdown made me have a TON of time. Also I have a few people in my close friends group who also do YouTube and those people encouraged me even further 
             to finally actually start. So I did. And that is how this journey started for me. I have to say I really have fun editing my videos and being as creative 
             as I can be with them.
